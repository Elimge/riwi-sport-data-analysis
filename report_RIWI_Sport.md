## 1. Executive Summary

Our analysis of RIWI Sport's transactional data reveals strong overall performance, with **Medellín** standing out as the primary revenue-driving market, particularly dominant in the **Tennis** category.

The most significant strategic finding is the **dual-market structure within the "Fitness" category**. While it appears to be a low-price category based on its median sale value, it uniquely concentrates a high number of premium, high-cost sales. This indicates an untapped opportunity to tailor marketing and sales strategies to two distinct customer segments: a high-volume, low-cost segment and a high-value, niche premium segment.

We recommend a **segmented commercial strategy for "Fitness"** to maximize revenue by increasing the average order value for the mass-market segment and enhancing customer lifetime value in the premium segment.
